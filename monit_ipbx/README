README for DICE iPBX monit Monitoring Scripts - Justin McCoy 08/13/2016

All DICE iPBX service's *.monit scripts depend on files placed into the "/drivers/" directory to enable monitoring.
These files are simply empty files that can be made using "touch" command. 

iPBX service monitoring file activatioh naming scheme:

DICE Call Routing 	==> /drivers/pbx_cr
DICE Channel Banking 	==> /drivers/pbx_cb
DICE M3			==> /drivers/pbx_m3
DICE Two-way/Auto dial	==> /drivers/pbx_ta
DICE Integrated Rec	==> /drivers/pbx_rc
DICE Voice		==> /drivers/pbx_vc

All DICE iPBX service scripts will restart service upon failure of service. Thresholds are set to initiate voice response,
and eventually stopping of monitoring should a process fail to start off of X amount of attempts. This is to avoid
"runaway" service restarts and nuisance alerts.
